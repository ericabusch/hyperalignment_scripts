# hyperalignment_scripts
## erica busch, 5/2020

This repository contains sample code for running searchlight hyperalignment on a dataset. You can create the conda environment with all necessary packages using the .yml file. The jupyter notebook walks you through each step by step, whereas the script you can run on a HPC cluster using the `submit_ha.sh` file from the commandline: `mksub submit_ha.sh` . Dataset_utils contains a bunch of dataset-specific functions that interace with the hyperalignment tutorials.
